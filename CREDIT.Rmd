## Articles and images

OF course we need to give credit where credit is due.
I've used pictures from different sites.

One of the coffee images is called [Coffee Cup and Stained by BenBois](http://vector.me/browse/401837/coffee_cup_and_stained), I've downloaded the picture from vector.me

Used a poem from [poetry soup](https://www.poetrysoup.com/poem/coffee_in_the_morning_time_932583)
By Maren Beauchamp

got some colors from [hanno Rein](http://hanno-rein.de/archives/349)


# Things we learned from

Help in explaining how to create rmarkdown templates with styling is from:
<https://github.com/ellisp/rmarkdown-corporate-eg> with explanation on <https://ellisp.github.io/blog/2017/09/09/rmarkdown>

But also of course on the [rmarkdown website](rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
