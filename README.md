It is written in the stars, that when a twitter hashtag is created, a community is born. As is true for the [\#rstatscoffeegeeks community](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstatscoffeegeeks).

This package contains basic needs for every rstatscoffeegeek.

-   an rmarkdowndocument template with coffee colors and image
-   a ggplot2 coffee theme
-   basic help for when your coffee doesn't taste great
-   coffee related emojis
-   coffee names

Install this package with `devtools::install_github("rmhogervorst/coffeegeeks")`

### How to use the template

To use the coffee rmarkdown template, install the package and go 'create new rmarkdown document'

![open new rmarkdown document](images/screenshot1.png)

Then in the dialog select Coffee theme

After knitting, the endresult looks something like this:

Using the ggplot2 theme
-----------------------

``` r
library(coffeegeeks)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars)+
    geom_point(aes(hp, wt, color = mpg))+
    scale_gradient_coffee()
```

![](README_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/coffeetheme-1.png)

``` r
ggplot(mtcars)+
    geom_density(aes(mpg, fill = as.factor(cyl)))+
    scale_fill_coffee()
```

![](README_files/figure-markdown_github-ascii_identifiers/coffeetheme-2.png)

Diagnosing your coffee problems
-------------------------------

Use the function `help_my_coffee_` .

``` r
help_my_coffee_(tastes = "bitter")
```

    ## A bitter flavour is often the result of extracting too much from the grounds.

    ##   adjust your grind or timing:

    ##   - make your grind courser AND/ OR let your coffee pass faster

    ## coarsening your grind will slow the process of extraction and allow you to find the right balance of flavor.
